# Student Dropout Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of **student dropout** using Machine Learning. It analyzes student records and identifies risk factors that may lead to dropout.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection
- Classification models for dropout prediction
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visual analysis of results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn


## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swathi-016/Student-Dropout-Prediction.git
cd Student-Dropout-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook Studentdropout.ipynb

Results

Built machine learning models to predict dropout risk

Identified key features influencing student retention

Future Work

Improve accuracy with ensemble methods

Use deep learning for complex feature interactions

Build a dashboard for educational institutions
